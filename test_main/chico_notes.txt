hello me...

database query function notes:
    1. You can add/register a new product/parcel but can also have the option not to add/assign it to a warehouse and warehouse_location.
    2. Assignment of products to warehouse and warehouse location, along with its quantities, will be in the ProductInventoryManagement.js -- same for parcels.
    3. warehouse_location can be deleted if product/parcel is deleted
    4. call a deletion of every product_id records in product_inventories using a function from ProductInventoryManagement.js which then also deletes the warehouse_location that is associated with the product_invetories table
    5. turns out that we cannot delete products or parcels if they are involved in an order and shipment.
        - solution: create archiving function so that we can delete them in-order to prevent foreign key constraints.
        - also orders and shipments should only be deleted if they are 'returned' or 'shipped'
    6. When currently shipping a parcel, quantity in parcel_inventory = 0
