1. Inventory Management
Tables for Inventory Tracking: Create tables for products, categories, inventory levels, and locations. Include fields for product IDs, descriptions, quantities on hand, reorder levels, and location details.
Real-Time Updates: Implement mechanisms for real-time updates to inventory records, which may require efficient indexing and transaction handling to ensure data accuracy and timeliness.
Audit Trails: Maintain audit trails or logs to track changes in inventory levels, including who made changes and when.
2. Order Fulfillment
Tables for Orders: Design tables to handle order details, including order IDs, customer information, product IDs, quantities, order statuses, and shipping details.
Order Processing Workflow: Implement tables or processes to manage order statuses and track the progress from picking to packing to shipping.
Relationships and Referential Integrity: Ensure foreign key relationships between orders, inventory, and customer tables to maintain data integrity.
3. Cost Reduction
Error Logging: Include error logging and exception handling mechanisms to capture and address any data discrepancies or system issues that might lead to errors.
Efficient Data Access: Optimize queries and indexing to reduce the likelihood of human errors in data retrieval and updates.
4. Warehouse Efficiency
Warehouse Layout: Design tables to represent warehouse layout, including sections, aisles, and bins. This helps in optimizing the placement and movement of goods.
Workflow Management: Create tables for workflow processes and handling instructions to streamline operations and improve efficiency.
5. Data Accuracy
Validation Rules: Implement data validation rules at the database level to ensure the accuracy and consistency of data.
Consistent Data Formats: Enforce consistent data formats (e.g., date formats, numerical precision) to avoid discrepancies.
6. Real-Time Visibility
Real-Time Data Access: Use technologies that support real-time data access and updates, such as in-memory databases or caching solutions.
Reporting and Analytics: Include tables and structures for generating real-time reports and analytics, which may involve aggregating data from various sources.
7. Scalability
Scalable Architecture: Design the database schema to support horizontal and vertical scaling. Consider partitioning large tables and using distributed databases if necessary.
Flexible Schema: Use a flexible schema design to accommodate changes in business requirements, such as adding new locations or functionalities.
Additional Considerations
Backup and Recovery: Implement backup and recovery procedures to protect against data loss and ensure business continuity.
Security: Include security features such as access control, encryption, and user authentication to protect sensitive data.
Performance Optimization: Optimize database performance through indexing, query optimization, and efficient storage management.
